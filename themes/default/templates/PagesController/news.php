	<p>We got married in September 2012. We got MARRIED!! 6 months now. Woo woo!  Many of you were able to be at our Wedding and we absolutely loved having you celebrate our Special Day with us and appreciate your love. Those who were elsewhere, we missed you! We hold dearly that you were able to celebrate with us from afar. </p>

<p>What happened after the Wedding? We spent two extremely relaxing days at a luxurious country manor house, The Bishopstrow Hotel and Spa which was an absolute delight. I didn't want to leave! We returned to Durrington, opened our lovely cards, ate Wedding cake as we booked our flights and packed for N.Z! </p>

<p>On 3rd October 2012 we said our goodbyes to our British and Brasilian families at the airport and off we flew. We had a stopover in Hong Kong for a few hours on the way, which was coincidentally Filype's birthday so we popped out for a dash around the bustling streets and had time for a bowl of noodles before heading onwards to Auckland. There we spent 2 lovely days on our 'mini-moon' reminiscing over romantic dining of when we met 5 years earlier. Then hopped on the 13 hour night bus (indeed!) to Wellington, arriving at 7am! </p>

<p>We spent some days with Uncle Phil and Julie which was lovely. Filype went straight back to full time work after 3 months working remotely from UK. I got my partnership work visa application together and 1 week later it was granted! Praise God. </p>

<p>Things were a little hectic for a while hopping around from car to house to hostel, hotel to apartment. During which time I was diligently sourcing our home essentials from Charity Shops! We love how many of our Wedding gifts gave twice, to us and to charity! Thank you! The car was getting very full and I was very much looking forward to unpacking and making our nest! We were hard out flat hunting for a good 6 weeks until we found our home. We moved into a little semi detached brick bungalow in Northland, Wellington near the Botanical Gardens on 13th Nov. Our &quot;Pear Tree Palace&quot;. So do come visit if you can! </p>
<p>Christmas, most people go away for summer holidays. (I know!) With all the leaping and bounding between countries until presently, we looked forward to enjoying our 1st Christmas as a married couple, in our new home. We have a front and back garden with great afternoon sun, and our landlord left us his BBQ! This summer has been fantastic. We are enjoying so many sunny days, however sadly, to the detriment of the land as the North Island is officially in a state of drought and there was even a scrub fire in Wellington. </p>

<p>I was back on with my StartUp business sewing and making again as soon as I could. Check out my latest projects and commissions here:  <br />

<p>As well as HONEmade, I took up my former nanny job again with a family that I worked for, 3 years previously. Now of course the children are a little older, 9 and 13 years old. I also took up babysitting again with the families I used to sit for. </p>

<p>Filype started us a vege garden. Turns out he has green fingers!  We've planted a whole bunch of vegetables, herbs and some fruit too, it's going really well. We have a rock melon growing, how cool?!</p>

<p>With all our home-making/nesting, it took a while to write out all our Wedding thank you cards. We are sorry for the delay it took to get them out! We are so happy that they have now been dispatched from 'The Palace'. Yaay!</p>

<p>We are very much enjoying being Newlywed! It's great to be in NZ, it may not be forever but for now we feel very blessed to be here. </p>

<p>Do drop us a line or call us on skype, we'd love to hear from you.<br />  
Esperamos receber not&iacute;cias suas tamb&eacute;m.</p>
