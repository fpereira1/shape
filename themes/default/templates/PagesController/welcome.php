	Hello! ...Welcome!<br />
	Kia Ora! (As they say here in N.Z)</p>

	<p>WE GOT MARRIED!!! ...in the UK on 28th September 2012 and moved to Wellington, New Zealand, 5 days after our Wedding!  </p>

	<p>You are here to see our Wedding photos!  Thank you for visiting. <br />
	This, then, is our opportunity to invite you as our guest, to be a frequent visitor.</p>

	<p>Now we are married as Filype and Lara Pereira, we are 'Pear Tree' and this is our online 'virtual' home. Welcome to our Tree House that Filype made!!  (Isn't my husband clever?)</p>

	<p>Presently, this is our Wedding Gallery to share with our guests. Later, this will be a place where we would like to share our lives with you also.  We will post photos, stories and such.  Make sure you visit often to see what's new over on this side of the world.  We will endeavor to keep you updated with our happenings as and when they, um, ...happen!</p>

	<p>If what you're reading here isn't enough to satiate your thirst for all things Pereira, or you'd just like a 2-way conversation, then, reach us here: laradawnandfilype@gmail.com</p>

	<p>Please make sure you sign our guestbook, check out our news and one more thing...<br />
	Enjoy the photos! </p>
